# PyTorch Architectures

PyTorch implementations of research paper model architectures

## Module Structure

The torcharch package is divided into the following submodules

* **models:** Architecture implementations divided into broad categories (i.e. convolutional, recurrent, etc)
* **data:** Utility functions and full dataset loaders
* **training:** Execute trainings and save model weights
