# PyTorch Architectures

PyTorch implementations of research paper model architectures

## Module Structure

The `torcharch` package is divided into the following submodules. 
Both `models` an `modules` are further divided into broad categories (i.e. convolutional, recurrent, etc)

* **models:** Complete architecture implementations
* **modules:** Helper components of various architectures
* **data:** Utility functions and full dataset loaders
* **training:** Execute trainings and save model weights
